<div style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Online search platforms influence product demand through their choices of how to order search results in response to their users’ queries. I study the identification of consumer-welfare changes in response to exogenous changes in these choices. I focus on the case of consumers engaging in costly searches for a single, indivisible (discrete) product among a collection of substitutes. I show that exact consumer-welfare changes–that is, compensating variation and equivalent variation–can be calculated with the use of straightforward integrals of the aggregate demand. I apply my results to shopping data provided by an online travel agency (OTA). I estimate that when the OTA changes the way it orders search results from random to its proprietary method, welfare improves by an average of $8.11 per user. I estimate an average welfare loss of $23.87 per user when the OTA removes the top five products from all of its search-result lists.</div>

<p><div><strong> Bank-Note-Demand Volatility and Crises in Canada </strong></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> I study the volatility of the demand for Canadian bank notes from January 1998 until August 2020. I use GARCH variance estimates, semi-parametric regression, and visualizations as my primary analytic tools. I find bank-note variation is highest from December 1999 through January 2000 and from March 2020 through May 2020. December 1999 through January 2000 correspond to the swift run-up and subsequent lapse of the Year 2000 (Y2K) Crisis fears in Canada. March 2020 through May 2020 correspond to the height of Canadian COVID-19 cases and government responses. In contrast, times of other recent financial crises are weakly associated with bank-note variation. I find that net withdrawals in December 1999 reflect a relative increase in the demand for $100 notes, while net withdrawals in March through May 2020 reflect a relative increase in the demand for $20 and $50 notes, with a decrease in the relative demand for $100. The relative demand for $5 and $10 notes was stable during both events. </div></p>
